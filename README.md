# 💬 MERN Stack Real-Time Chat Application

A full-stack real-time chat application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) with Socket.IO for instant messaging.
The app supports secure authentication, real-time communication, and persistent chat storage.

This project was my first complete full-stack application and helped me gain hands-on experience with frontend–backend integration, authentication, and real-time systems.
